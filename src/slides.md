## Outline

* Introduction
* Web Applications
* Writing Web Applications with Haskell
    - Scotty
    - Yesod
    - Airship
* Client-Side Technologies

\notelist{
  \item Today, after a high-level introduction, we'll talk about web applications
  \item Specifically, we will talk about writing webapps in Haskell
  \item I'll demonstrate some frameworks available
  \item And say a few words about client-side technologies
}

# Introduction

## Evolving Software

* New features
* Bug fixes
* Refactoring
* External factors
    - New regulation
    - Deprecation of software and services
* Recruiting

\notelist{
  \item There are many reasons to evolve software
  \item We will probably have ...
}

## Risks

* Evolving software, we face risks:
    - Delay
    - Error
    - Burnout
* These risks make it scary to evolve freely

\notelist{
  \item When evolving software, we risk: ...
  \item These things hurt not only ourselves, but: Customers, partners, internal relations
  \item The risks make it scary to evolve our software freely
  \item The change you want to make can be too risky
  \item I think the fear of evolving software freely has a huge impact on our systems
}

## Tooling

* We can reduce fear with better tools
    - Stronger correctness guarantees
    - Robustness
    - Faster feedback
    - Communicates intent
* Functional programming
* Type systems
* Error handling

# Web Applications

## Web Applications

* Many of us work with the web somehow
* Single-page apps (SPAs) are in vogue
    - More like desktop apps
    - Reinventing parts of the browser
    - No Javascript, no application
* Universal webapps (aka "isomorphic")

\notelist{
  \item Many of us work with the web in one way or another ... (internet)
  \item Currently, single-page apps are trendy. These work more like ...
  \item Now, you might think "What about universal webapps?"
  \item They are about initial rendering, not about transparently running the same application client-side and server-side
}

## Reminder

\centering{\Large{$\text{Newer} \not\Longrightarrow \text{Better}$}}

\notelist{
  \item This is my friendly reminder: Never does not imply better
  \item While the single-page app tech is very new and flashy, it might not be a good choice for your project
}

## Server-Side Web Applications

* Do not dismiss server-side web applications
* Progressive enhancement
* 80/20 rule
* Use client-side code where you need it!
* PJAX

\notelist{
  \item I urge you not to dismiss server-side web applications
  \item Rather, have that as a default choice
  \item You can use what's known as "Progressive Enhancement", where ...
  \item Also important to recognize: All code is not equally valuable
  \item Pages for Settings, Login, Documentation, etc
  \item Use client-side code where you need it, where you get a return on the investment
  \item If you want more snappy navigation, things like PJAX go a long way
}

## Static Typing for Server-Side Web

* Compile-time checking
    - Run-time robustness with defined behaviour
    - Use types for correct-by-construction
    - Machine-verified living documentation, communicates intent
* Safely evolve our codebase
    - Reduce fear of change throughout the codebase
    - Modify core domain, follow the errors
    - Not split by an API
* Focus tests on our domain
    - No need to write tests for type errors
    - Domain code free of side effects

\notelist{
  \item Combining server-side web with static typing, we get a lot of benefits
}

## Functional Statically Typed Web

\begin{columns}[T,onlytextwidth]
  \begin{column}{.7\textwidth}
    \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Many languages, many frameworks!
        \item Look for the patterns and safety
        \item Less power is more power
        \item Today's focus is Haskell
      \end{itemize}
    \end{minipage}

    \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=2.5cm]{../../src/haskell.png}
    \end{minipage}
  \end{column}
\end{columns}

\notelist{
  \item There are many languages and frameworks in this spirit
  \item Base your decisions on the underlying patterns and safety guarantees
  \item This often comes down to: Less power is more power
  \item As Michael explained this morning, as you can't sneak in side-effects in Haskell, libraries like STM can give strong guarantees
  \item My examples will use Haskell for that reason
}

# Writing Web Applications with Haskell

## Underpinnings

* Web Application Interface (WAI)
    - Common interface betwen web applications and web servers
    - Mix frameworks in one application
    - Comparable with Java Servlet API
* Warp
    - WAI web server
    - Uses GHC's lightweight threads

\notelist{
  \item The Haskell web frameworks we'll look at all build on WAI, ...
  \item Warp is a popular and fast web server for WAI
}

## Frameworks

* Scotty
* Spock
* Yesod
* Happstack
* Snap
* Airship
* Servant
* MFlow

\notelist{
  \item In the Haskell ecosystem, there are many web frameworks.
  \item This list is not exhaustive
  \item We will look at three of these frameworks: Scotty, Yesod, and Airship
}

# Scotty

## Scotty

* Inspired by Ruby's Sinatra
* Features
    - Routing and parameters
    - Web server setup
    - Extensible
* "Build your own framework"

\notelist{
  \item Inspired by Ruby's Sinatra
  \item It provides routing, parameters, and form parsing
  \item It is easy to get started, setting up a web server
  \item Scotty is extensible. I'm not going to say it, but it has to do with the M-word.
  \item Scotty is very small, and if you build something bigger, you'll likely have to "build your own framework"
}

## Scotty Routing

``` {.haskell include=src/listings/scotty-demo/src/Scotty.hs snippet=app}
```

\notelist{
  \item This is a Scotty app with two routes
  \item (explain code)
}

## Scotty Server

``` {.haskell include=src/listings/scotty-demo/src/Scotty.hs snippet=main}
```

\notelist{
  \item This is how we run it
  \item Now, usually you need to render larger chunks of HTML
}

## HTML Templates

``` {.haskell}
get "/greet-with-template/:who" $ do
  who <- param "who"
  html $
       "<!DOCTYPE html>\
       \<html lang=\"en\">\
       \<head>\
       \  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\
       \  <title>My Page</title>\
       \  <link rel=\"stylesheet\"\
       \        href=" <> bootstrapCss <> "\">\
       \</head>\
       \<body>\
       \  <div class=\"jumbotron\">\
       \     <h1>Hello, " <> who <> "!</h1>\
       \  </div>\
       \</body>\
       \</html>"
```

\notelist{
  \item Let's say we do this
  \item It is very hard to read
  \item Sure, we could refactor to separate view functions
  \item The bigger issue is that we're doing stringly-typed programming
  \item \textbf{Can anyone tell me what's wrong here?}
}

## HTML Template Error!

\begin{textblock*}{0cm}(2.5cm,4.0cm)
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at(0, 0) [draw, stringcolor,line width=3pt,ellipse, minimum width=80pt, minimum height=20pt]{};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{textblock*}

``` {.haskell}
get "/greet-with-template/:who" $ do
  who <- param "who"
  html $
       "<!DOCTYPE html>\
       \<html lang=\"en\">\
       \<head>\
       \  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\
       \  <title>My Page</title>\
       \  <link rel=\"stylesheet\"\
       \        href=" <> bootstrapCss <> "\">\
       \</head>\
       \<body>\
       \  <div class=\"jumbotron\">\
       \     <h1>Hello, " <> who <> "!</h1>\
       \  </div>\
       \</body>\
       \</html>"
```

\notelist{
  \item We are missing an escaped double quote here
  \item The string literal's quote makes it extra hard to see
  \item So, let's not do this.
}

## DSLs for HTML

* Instead of HTML in strings, we use DSLs
* Embedded:
    - Blaze
    - Lucid
* External:
    - Heist
    - Hamlet
* Type safety
* Composable

\notelist{
  \item Instead we use a markup DSL
  \item There are embedded and external DSLs for HTML
  \item Embedded means the markup is written in regular Haskell, in Haskell source files
  \item Two popular libraries are Blaze and Lucid
  \item For external HTML templating languages, we can use Heist or Hamlet
  \item The external ones are typically written in separate files, but can also be embedded using quasi-quoting
  \item These languages give us type-safe templates that are composable
  \item They help us produce valid HTML
}

## Lucid HTML Template

``` {.haskell include=src/listings/scotty-demo/src/Scotty.hs snippet=lucid-template}
```

\notelist{
  \item Here we see the equivalent template in Lucid
  \item Elements are nested using function application
  \item Elements are juxtaposed using do notation
  \item Attributes are set using a list of pairs
  \item Notice how some functions do not take any child content
  \item `meta` and `link` in HTML are empty elements
  \item In this way, Lucid and the type system help us construct valid HTML
}

## Rendering Lucid with Scotty

``` {.haskell include=src/listings/scotty-demo/src/Scotty.hs snippet=lucid-handler dedent=2}
```

\notelist{
  \item We can render Lucid in a handler like this
}

## Result

![](../../src/lucid-hello.png){width=75%}

\notelist{
  \item Looking at the result in a web browser, we can inspect the rendered HTML
}

## Side Effects in Scotty

* We need more than sending HTML responses
* We want to do IO:
    - Database queries
    - Logging
    - External service calls
* IO in Scotty handlers using `liftIO`

\notelist{
  \item So far, we have only sent HTML over the wire
  \item We most likely need side-effects to do something useful
  \item (read list)
  \item We use `liftIO` in Scotty handlers to do IO
}

## IO in Scotty

* Given these definitions:

    ``` {.haskell include=src/listings/scotty-demo/src/Scotty.hs snippet=addNewComment}
    ```
* We can \textit{lift} the IO action into a handler:

    ``` {.haskell include=src/listings/scotty-demo/src/Scotty.hs snippet=article-handler dedent=2}
    ```

\notelist{
  \item Let's look at an example of using `liftIO`
  \item Given these definitions... (explain rest)
}


## Starting with Scotty

* Easy to get started, learn the basics
* What you don't get:
    - Templating
    - Sessions
    - Authentication and Authorization
    - Logging
    - Persistence
* Have a look at Spock\fnote{\url{https://www.spock.li}} for more features

\notelist{
  \item I recommend starting out with Scotty if you're new to Haskell web development
  \item Once your applications grows, you will probably need to bring in libraries
  \item You might need to bring in ... (read list)
  \item For a slightly larger feature set, and type-safe routing, have a look at Spock
}

# Yesod

## Yesod

* "One-stop shop" for Haskell web development
    - A framework
    - Batteries included
    - Still very modular
* Also runs on WAI

\notelist {
  \item Yesod can be called a "one-stop shop" for Haskell web development
  \item It is a framework with many batteries included
  \item Still, it is implemented to be modular
  \item Things are there by default, but you can swap them out if you need
  \item Yesod runs on WAI using the Warp server
}

## Batteries Included with Yesod

\begin{columns}[T,onlytextwidth]
  \begin{column}{.5\textwidth}
    \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Type-safe routing
        \item External templates for:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item HTML
            \item CSS
            \item Javascript (and TypeScript)
          \end{itemize}
        \item Widgets
        \item Forms
        \item Sessions
      \end{itemize}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Integration with Persistent
        \item Authentication and Authorization
        \item Internationalization
        \item Logging
        \item Configuration
        \item Auto-reloading web server
      \end{itemize}
    \end{minipage}
  \end{column}
\end{columns}

\notelist {
  \item These are some of the features you get ... (read list)
}

## Getting Started

* Use a template (see `stack templates`)
* There will be things you don't understand at first
* Start out exploring:
    - Routing
    - Templates (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
    - The "Foundation" type
    - Getting something done!
* Over time, you'll understand the scaffolding
* Use the auto-reloading web server
    - Install `yesod-bin`, run `yesod devel`

\notelist {
  \item I recommend starting by using a template
  \item (read list)
}

## Routes Configuration

``` {.changelog include=src/listings/yesod-demo/config/routes snippet=routes}
```

\notelist {
  \item Routes are configured in a separate file
  \item We define a root path ...
}

## A Simple Handler

``` {.haskell include=src/listings/yesod-demo/src/Handler/Home.hs snippet=get-home-handler}
```

\notelist {
  \item The handler for a route is found by a naming convention
  \item "HomeR GET" corresponds to the "getHomeR" definition
}

## Hamlet Template

``` {.hamlet include=src/listings/yesod-demo/templates/homepage.hamlet}
```

\notelist {
  \item This is "homepage.hamlet"
}

## Routing with Path Pieces

``` {.haskell include=src/listings/yesod-demo/src/Handler/Home.hs snippet=get-article-handler}
```

\notelist {
  \item Routes with "PathPieces" captured have handlers with arguments
  \item The route for a particular article captured an "ArticleId" in the routes file
  \item This handler therefore has an "ArticleId" argument
}

## Article Hamlet Template

``` {.hamlet include=src/listings/yesod-demo/templates/article.hamlet}
```

## Widgets

* Reusable components of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* We used widgets in handlers:

	```{.haskell}
  $(widgetFile "article")
	```

* Yesod tries to find matching widget files:

	```{.changelog}
	templates/article.hamlet
	templates/article.cassius
	templates/article.lucius
	templates/article.julius
	```

* Can refer to bindings in Haskell code
* Only include small parts, or use external resources

\notelist {
  \item Let's have a look at the concept of a "Widget"
  \item (read list)
}

## Lucius (CSS Templates)

``` {.css include=src/listings/yesod-demo/templates/article.lucius}
```

\notelist {
  \item Here's some simple styling of comments
  \item This is a Lucius file
  \item You can interpolate Haskell values, but I'm not doing that here
}

## Home Page Result

![](../../src/yesod-home.png){width=75%}

\notelist {
  \item Using a web browser, the home page looks like this
}

## Article Page Result

![](../../src/yesod-article.png){width=75%}

\notelist {
  \item And the article page now has comments rendered
}

## Yesod Forms

* Write forms using applicative or monadic style
* Use the same structure for rendering, parsing, and validation
* There are various renderers available

\notelist {
  \item The next powerful feature of Yesod that I want to show is forms
  \item (read list)
}

## Comment Form

``` {.haskell include=src/listings/yesod-demo/src/Handler/Home.hs snippet=comment-form}
```

\notelist {
  \item This is a definition of a Yesod Form
  \item It is a form for Comments
  \item It has a text field for the commenter name
  \item And it has a text area for the comment contents
  \item This is a single definition for both rendering the form, and parsing incoming form data
}

## Rendering a Form

``` {.haskell include=src/listings/yesod-demo/src/Handler/Home.hs snippet=get-article-with-form-handler}
```

\notelist {
  \item Here's how we use the form in a handler
  \item First, we get the article and its comments
  \item Then, we use "generateFormPost"
  \item We get a widget back, that is included in the HTML template below
}

## Including The Form Widget

``` {.hamlet}
<form role=form
      method=post
      action=@{ArticleCommentsR id'}
      enctype=#{commentFormEnc}>
  ^{commentFormWidget}
  <button type="submit" .btn .btn-default>Submit
```

## Parsing and Validating the Form

``` {.haskell include=src/listings/yesod-demo/src/Handler/Home.hs snippet=article-comment-handler}
```

\notelist {
  \item The POST handler uses "runFormPost" to parse the form data, and render a new form
  \item If it was success in parsing it, we add the comment and redirect back
  \item Otherwise, we rerender the form
  \item The neat thing is that Yesod will render validation errors automatically
}

## Comment Form Result

![](../../src/yesod-form.png){width=75%}

\notelist {
  \item In the browser, we see the rendered form
}

## Yesod Recap

* Very capable, hit the ground running
* We only looked at some core features
* Worth learning

\notelist{
  \item To summarize the part on Yesod ...
  \item Yesod has much of you might need
  \item You don't have to build your own framework, at least not for some time
  \item I think it's worth learning if you want to build web apps in Haskell
  \item But if you're beginning Haskell, start with Scotty or Spock
}

# Airship

\notelist {
  \item The last framework we'll look at is Airship
}

## Airship

* Inspired by Webmachine from Erlang
* Define RESTful resources
* Override fields in the default resource
* Tie together resources with routing

\notelist {
  \item Airship is inspired by Webmachine from Erlang
  \item It is centered around RESTful resources
  \item You use the default resource, which does all the sensible defaults
  \item Then you override methods to implement your resource
  \item Resources are tied together using a routing DSL (...)
}

## Airship Routes

``` {.haskell include=src/listings/airship-demo/src/Main.hs snippet=app-routes}
```

\notelist {
  \item In this example, we define two routes ...
}

## Defining Resources

``` {.haskell}
articleResource :: Resource IO
articleResource =
  defaultResource
  {
	-- overrides ...
  }
```

\notelist {
  \item A resource overrides fields in the default resource
}

## resourceExists

``` {.changelog}
...
```

``` {.haskell include=src/listings/airship-demo/src/Main.hs snippet=resourceExists}
```

``` {.changelog}
...
```

\notelist {
  \item This overrides basically answers: is this a 404 Not Found?
}

## contentTypesProvided

``` {.changelog}
...
```

``` {.haskell include=src/listings/airship-demo/src/Main.hs snippet=contentTypesProvided}
```

``` {.changelog}
...
```

\notelist {
  \item This override is a bit more involved
  \item Here we bind a special function for constructing an HTML response
  \item Then, in case the content type is text/html, we get the article, and render it
  \item If it has another content type, based on the Accept header, we do nothing
  \item Airship handles that for us
}

## 404 Not Found

``` bash
$ curl -i 'localhost:3000'
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Tue, 12 Dec 2017 15:43:29 GMT
Server: Warp/3.2.13
Content-Type: text/html

Not found!
```

\notelist {
  \item Let's test our server using curl
  \item Requesting a non-existing resource we get 404 Not Found
}

## 405 Method Not Allowed

``` bash
$ curl -i -X PUT 'localhost:3000/articles/1'
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Tue, 12 Dec 2017 15:44:21 GMT
Server: Warp/3.2.13
Allow: GET,HEAD,POST
```

\notelist {
  \item Requesting the article with PUT we get 405 Method Not Allowed
}

## 406 Not Acceptable

``` bash
$ curl -i -H 'Accept: text/plain' 'localhost:3000/articles/1'
HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Tue, 12 Dec 2017 15:48:27 GMT
Server: Warp/3.2.13
```

\notelist {
  \item Passing "Accept: text/plain", we get 406 Not Acceptable
}

## 200 OK

``` bash
$ curl -i 'localhost:3000/articles/1'
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Tue, 12 Dec 2017 15:45:29 GMT
Server: Warp/3.2.13
Content-Type: text/html

<h1>Airship Webmachines!</h1><p>Lorem ipsum...</p>
```

\notelist {
  \item And finally, we can do a GET request and get the HTML
}

## Airship Overrides

```{.changelog}
allowMissingPost           lastModified
allowedMethods             languageAvailable
contentTypesAccepted       malformedRequest
contentTypesProvided       movedPermanently
deleteCompleted            movedTemporarily
deleteResource             multipleChoices
entityTooLarge             previouslyExisted
  forbidden                  processPost
generateETag               resourceExists
implemented                serviceAvailable
isAuthorized               uriTooLong
isConflict                  validContentHeaders
knownContentType
```

\notelist {
  \item I only showed you two, but there are many more overrides
}

## Airship Considerations

* It is more low-level/barebones
* Again, "build your own framework"
* Suited for RESTful APIs

\notelist {
  \item Airship is a bit rough on the edges
  \item I didn't show you the setup to get it running
  \item It requires some effort to integrate with other libraries
  \item But if you're building a RESTful API, Airship might be a great choice!
}

# Client-Side Technologies

## Client-Side Technologies

Need to do a single-page app?

* PureScript, Elm, etc
* Consider Haskell for your backend
* With Servant, you can use `servant-purescript` or `servant-elm`

\notelist {
  \item If you need to do a single-page app, or a single-page component of a greater system, consider...
  \item These are in the same spirit, more or less
  \item Consider Haskell for your backend, even it's only serving JSON
  \item You can use all the frameworks I've shown to build web APIs
  \item Also, there is Servant, to get a lot of type-safety in web APIs
  \item Servant can be integrated with PureScript and Elm to share types
}

# Summary

\notelist {
  \item Evolve software fearlessly using better tools for modeling and communication.
  \item Your program is a communication between you, your colleagues, and the computer
  \item Use tools that support that communication
  \item Use tools that support \textbf{evolving} your ideas, not only implementing your first idea

\notelist {
  \item Spend your complexity budget carefully.
  \item Large parts of your web application are of lower value than core business parts
  \item Reach for simple tools with less risk in those areas
  \item When needed, use more advanced and complex tools where you get return on investment
